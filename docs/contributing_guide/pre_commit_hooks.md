# Pre-commit hooks

[We use pre-commit hooks to ensure all our commits meet a minimum standard in terms of
security, type hinting, and formatting and linting][pre-commit]. You only need to
enable hooks once after you've cloned this repository, and installed the requirements.

```zsh
pre-commit install
```

These hooks are run each time you make a commit, whether that's from the command line,
or through an IDE. If any of the hooks fail, you won't be able to commit your changes
until the issues detected by the hooks have been resolved.

Some hooks will automatically fix issues for you. To incorporate these auto-fixes,
first manually fix other issues (if any), and then stage the new changes in Git, and
re-commit your code.

## Hooks currently in use

A brief summary of the pre-commit hooks we use is shown in the table below. If a hook
fails, please see its documentation on how to resolve it.

| Name                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
